## PA 470

Hello and welcome to ML/AI for the Public Sector (PA 470). 

Firstly, I want to thank you for your interest in this course. I am excited to have you in the class and I am looking forward to a great semester. I would also like to apologise for the delay in the blackbaord announcement. 

The course will mostly be administered through GitHub. I will be posting all the assignments, and other course materials on GitHub. You will be required to submit your assignments and quizzes through GitHub. The course website is available here - https://github.com/uic-cuppa-pa470-spring2025/course-website/tree/main

The syllabus for the course is also linked on the course website here - https://github.com/uic-cuppa-pa470-spring2025/course-website/blob/main/0_Syllabus.pdf. Please take a look at it and let me know if you have any questions.

**Assignment Instructions:**

The assignments will be posted on GitHub every week. 

Initial setup - Please create a GitHub account if you do not have one. You will need to submit your assignments through GitHub. I would recommend that you create an account using an email you will have access to beyond this course as well. 

Once you have created an account, please accept the first assignment here - https://classroom.github.com/a/lNo4S76r 

Once you click accept, you will be asked to link it with your UIC email id. Please do so. It is not a hard linking of your UIC email ID, but rather, an identifier primarily for me to know who you are, and upload your corresponding grades on Blackboard. If you do not find your UIC email ID in the list, please let me know.

The instructions for the first assignment will show up once you accept the assignment.

The goal of the first assignment is simple, to have you set up R, RStudio, and GitHub on your computer. Once you `git push` your assignment, it will be considered as submitted. Feel free to push as many times as you need. 

Here are a few links to get you started with the setup:

- R - https://cran.r-project.org/
- RStudio - https://posit.co/downloads/
- GitHub - 
    - Command Line / Terminal - 
        - MacOS / Linux - You should have `git` installed locally, and should be able to `git clone` the repository and `git push` your changes.
        - Windows - You can download the Command Line Tool from https://git-scm.com/downloads
    - GUI -
        - GitHub Desktop - https://desktop.github.com/download/

Simple guides to get you started with Git/GitHub:

- https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial
- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/
- https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop
- https://www.atlassian.com/git
- https://learngitbranching.js.org

Generally speaking, these are the things you will need to know for the first assignment.:

- How to **clone** or copy a repository from GitHub to your local computer.
    - `git clone <repository-url>`
- How to **commit** changes to the repository. (This is how you save your work!)
    - `git add <file-name>`
    - `git commit -m "Your commit message"`
- How to **push** changes from your local computer to GitHub.
    - `git push`

All of these commands can be run from the terminal or command line. The GUI app should have buttons for these actions. 

**If you are unable to get this set up, please reach out to me.** It is totally fine if you will not be able to get it done by the deadline. There will be no penalisation at all, and I will be happy to help you out with the setup before the next lecture.

Please let me know if you have any questions at all!
